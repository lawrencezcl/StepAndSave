# 🚀 Step-and-Save: Complete Implementation Summary

**"Walk. Tap. Save." - Converting steps into instant spendable coupons on VERY Network**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Step-and-Save is now a fully implemented Web3 loyalty engine that transforms daily footsteps into spendable "Step-Coupon" NFTs. This implementation aligns perfectly with the DoraHacks BUIDL submission and provides a complete, production-ready solution.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🔗 Smart Contracts (VERY Network)
- **[`StepCouponFactory.sol`](./contracts/contracts/StepCouponFactory.sol)**: ERC-721 NFT factory for minting step coupons
- **[`MerchantBidRegistry.sol`](./contracts/contracts/MerchantBidRegistry.sol)**: Merchant registration and bidding system
- **[`Redeemer.sol`](./contracts/contracts/Redeemer.sol)**: Coupon redemption and fee management

### 📱 Frontend Applications
- **User App**: React-based Verychat mini-app with step tracking and coupon management
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Complete merchant interface for offers, bids, and redemptions
- **PWA Support**: Installable mobile app with offline capabilities

### 🛠️ Backend Services
- **[`RelayerService`](./backend/src/services/relayer/RelayerService.ts)**: Gasless meta-transactions on VERY Network
- **[`GeofencingService`](./backend/src/services/geofencing/GeofencingService.ts)**: Location-based coupon validation
- **API Layer**: RESTful APIs for all operations with WebSocket real-time updates

### 🏗️ Architecture Features
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized workspaces for contracts, frontend, backend, and dashboard
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all components
- **Security**: Role-based access control, input validation, and rate limiting
- **Scalability**: Docker support, CI/CD ready, and production optimizations

## 🎮 Core Features Implemented

### For Users (Walkers)
- ✅ **Step Tracking**: Real-time step counting with ZK attestation
- ✅ **Coupon Minting**: Convert 1,000 steps into NFT coupons
- ✅ **Location Validation**: Geofenced coupon creation
- ✅ **Bid Management**: Accept merchant offers for coupons
- ✅ **Wallet Integration**: Seamless VERY Network wallet connection
- ✅ **Social Sharing**: Share savings achievements

### For Merchants
